# PlayStore_Screenshot_Sizes


When I publish apps I use the following screenshot sizes:

Phone: 1080 x 1920 I prepare 8 images with title, some fancy background and a screenshot inside a smartphone mockup. So it's more than a simple screenshot. It gives some nice branding and helps you to stand out from other apps out there.

Tablet 7": 1200 x 1920 - I do actually a couple of raw screenshots of 7" emulator so that the user could know how the layout will appear on his device. No fancy design with titles etc.

Tablet 10": 1800 x 2560 - same thing here, just a couple of raw screenshots.

all in .png format. Hope this helps.
